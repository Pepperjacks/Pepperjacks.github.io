		<h1>RCE Tables Repository</h1>
		<p>This site hosts a number of tables representing the presence of remote code execution vulnerabilities in Java deserialization when combining versions of the Java Virtual Machine and versions of libraries. Each table corresponds to a payload of the research tool <a href=https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial>ysoserial</a>, which can be utilized to detect these vulnerabilities. As such, the libraries tested for each payload are the libraries included in each ysoserial attack, though there are a couple that don't use any libraries at all.
		
		For each table, the rows represent a version of the JVM (218 in total), and the columns represent a version of a library. If the combination of these two led to the presence of an RCE vulnerability during deserialization, the cell will be colored red. If not, the cell will be colored green.</p>
